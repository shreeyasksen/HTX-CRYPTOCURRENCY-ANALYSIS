Cryptocurrency Forensic Analysis – HTX Data Science Challenge
📌 Overview
This project explores Ethereum market data and wallet transactions to uncover anomalies and behavioral patterns. It combines API integration, data visualization, and forensic techniques to analyze blockchain activity.

🚀 What’s Inside
Historical price, market cap, and volume data from CoinGecko

Anomaly detection using z-score analysis

Wallet transaction data from Etherscan

Transaction graph visualization with networkx

Forensic insights from transaction size and timing

🛠️ How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your Etherscan API key

Run all cells from top to bottom

Outputs will include graphs, tables, and anomaly highlights

📈 Key Insights
Detected price spikes and drops using statistical thresholds

Visualized wallet relationships and transaction flows

Identified high-value transfers and behavioral timing patterns

📚 Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

NetworkX, SciPy

CoinGecko & Etherscan APIs
